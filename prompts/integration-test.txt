Can you help me write integration tests for a c++20 server project based on cpp-httplib? The test
should do the following:

1. start the service in a separate thread
2. request the serivce version by making a GET request to https://localhost:22022/version; verify the version string response
3. request the index page with GET https://localhost:22022/version; verify the <title> tag in the page
4. stop the service with a DELETE request https://localhost:22022/shutdown
5. verify that the service thread has stopped

For now the values, endpoints, etc can be hard-coded.  I can changes them after the basics are complete.
